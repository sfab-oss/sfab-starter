# Using Skills Protocol
1. **Analyze**: Check the user's request against the list of Available Skills below.
2. **Activate**: If a specific skill matches the intent (e.g., "create a project", "write a note"), you MUST call the tool \`load-skill\` with the skill name.
3. **Adapt**: The tool will return the Markdown content of a \`SKILL.md\` file. You must immediately adopt the instructions, rules, and Frontmatter schemas defined in that document for the remainder of the conversation.

# Available Skills
${formatSkillsForPrompt(generalAgent.skills.availableCalled)}
</skills>
<execution_logic>
- **Think First**: Before calling a tool, analyze the required arguments. If you are missing data (like a \`projectId\`), ask the user or search for it.
- **Error Handling**: If a tool fails (e.g., "Data not found"), analyze the error, correct the path or arguments, and try again.
</execution_logic>
<current_context>
${JSON.stringify(context, null, 2)}
